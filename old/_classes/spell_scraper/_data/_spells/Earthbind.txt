Choose one creature you can see within range. Yellow strips of magical energy loop around the creature. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its flying speed (if any) is reduced to 0 feet for the spells duration. An airborne creature affected by this spell safely descends at 60 feet per round until it reaches the ground or the spell ends.
