Barbarian,Rage,"In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On Your Turn, you can enter a rage as a Bonus Action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

- You have advantage on Strength Checks and Strength Saving Throws.

- When you make a melee weapon Attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.

- You have Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast Spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked Unconscious or if Your Turn ends and you haven't attacked a Hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on Your Turn as a Bonus Action.

Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your Barbarian level, you must finish a Long Rest before you can rage again. You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th."
Barbarian,Unarmored Defense,"While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit."
Barbarian,Danger Sense,"At 2nd Level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws against Effects that you can see, such as traps and Spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be Blinded, Deafened, or Incapacitated."
Barbarian,Reckless Attack,"Starting at 2nd Level, you can throw aside all concern for Defense to Attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first Attack on Your Turn, you can decide to Attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon Attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but Attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn."
Barbarian,Primal Path,"At 3rd Level, you choose a path that shapes the Nature of your rage, such as the Path of the Berserker. Your choice grants you features at 3rd Level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels."
All Classes,Ability Score Improvement,"When you reach 4th Level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature."
"Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger",Extra Attack,"Beginning at 5th Level, you can Attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on Your Turn."
Barbarian,Fast Movement,"Starting at 5th Level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy Armor."
Barbarian,Feral Instinct,"By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on Initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of Combat and aren't Incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn."
Barbarian,Brutal Critical,"Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee Attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level."
Barbarian,Relentless Rage,"Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10."
Barbarian,Persistent Rage,"Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall Unconscious or if you choose to end it."
Barbarian,Indomitable Might,"Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total."
Barbarian,Primal Champion,"At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24."
Bard,Bardic Inspiration,"You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a Bonus Action on Your Turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, Attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls The D20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th Level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level."
Bard,Jack of All Trades,"Starting at 2nd Level, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your Proficiency Bonus."
Bard,Song of Rest,"Beginning at 2nd Level, you can use soothing music or oration to help Revitalize your wounded allies during a Short Rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your Performance regain Hit Points by spending Hit Dice at the end of the Short Rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 Hit Points.

The extra Hit Points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level."
Bard,Bard College,"At 3rd Level, you delve into the advanced Techniques of a Bard College of your choice, such as the College of Lore. Your choice grants you features at 3rd Level and again at 6th and 14th level."
Bard,Expertise,"At 3rd Level, choose two of your skill Proficiencies. Your Proficiency Bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen Proficiencies.

At 10th level, you can choose another two skill Proficiencies to gain this benefit."
Bard,Font of Inspiration,"Beginning when you reach 5th Level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or Long Rest."
Bard,Countercharm,"At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing Effects. As an action, you can start a Performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on Saving Throws against being Frightened or Charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The Performance ends early if you are Incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required)."
Bard,Magical Secrets,"By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two Spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.

The chosen Spells count as Bard Spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.

You learn two additional Spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level."
Bard,Superior Inspiration,"At 20th level, when you roll Initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use."
Cleric,Divine Domain,"Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life. The Life Domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you Domain Spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd Level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

Domain Spells

Each domain has a list of spells-its domain spells-that you gain at the Cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of Spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the Cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Cleric spell for you."
Cleric,Channel Divinity,"At 2nd Level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical Effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an Effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional Effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which Effect to create. You must then finish a short or Long Rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity Effects require Saving Throws. When you use such an Effect from this class, the DC equals your Cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or Long Rest, you regain your expended uses."
Cleric,Destroy Undead,"Starting at 5th Level, when an Undead of CR 1/2 or lower fails its saving throw against Your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed."
Cleric,Divine Intervention,"Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the Nature of the intervention; the Effect of any Cleric spell or Cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a Long Rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required."
Cleric,Life Domain,"The Life Domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through Healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities, sun gods, gods of Healing or endurance, and gods of home and community.

Life Domain Spells
Cleric Level        Spells
1st        Bless, Cure Wounds
3rd        Lesser Restoration, Spiritual Weapon
5th        Beacon of Hope, Revivify
7th        Death Ward, Guardian of Faith
9th        Mass Cure Wounds, Raise Dead"
Cleric,Disciple of Life,"Also starting at 1st level, your Healing Spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to Restore Hit Points to a creature, the creature regains additional Hit Points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.
"
Cleric,Channel Divinity: Turn Undead,"As an action, you present your holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring the Undead. Each Undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take Reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an Effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action."
Cleric,Channel Divinity: Preserve Life,"Starting at 2nd Level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy Symbol and evoke Healing energy that can restore a number of Hit Points equal to five times your Cleric level.

Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those Hit Points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an Undead or a Construct."
Cleric,Blessed Healer,"Beginning at 6th level, the Healing Spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you Cast a Spell of 1st level or higher that restores Hit Points to a creature other than you, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 + the spell’s level."
Cleric,Divine Strike,"At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon Attack, you can cause the Attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8."
Cleric,Supreme Healing,"Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to Restore Hit Points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature, you restore 12."
Druid,Druidic,"You know Druidic, the Secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a Message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic."
Druid,Wild Shape,"Starting at 2nd Level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or Long Rest.

Your druid level determines the Beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd Level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a Challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

Beast Shapes
Level        Max. CR        Limitations        Example
2nd        1/4        No flying or swimming speed        Wolf
4th        1/2        No flying speed        Crocodile
8th        1        —        Giant EagleYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a Bonus Action on Your Turn. You automatically revert if you fall Unconscious, drop to 0 Hit Points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

Your game Statistics are replaced by the Statistics of the beast, but you retain your Alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw Proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or Lair Actions, you can't use them.
When you transform, you assume the beast's Hit Points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of Hit Points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of Dropping to 0 Hit Points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 Hit Points, you aren't knocked Unconscious.
You can't cast Spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your Concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking Actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you've already cast.
You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your Special Senses, such as Darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
You choose whether your Equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn Equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of Equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your Equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any Equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no Effect until you leave the form."
Druid,Druid Circle,"At 2nd Level, you choose to Identify with a circle of druids, such as the Circle of the Land. Your choice grants you features at 2nd Level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level."
Druid,Timeless Body,"Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year."
Druid,Beast Spells,"Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your Druid Spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal Components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material Components."
Druid,Archdruid,"At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic Components of your Druid Spells, as well as any material Components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape."
Druid,Land’s Stride,"Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical Difficult Terrain costs you no extra Movement. You can also pass through nonmagical Plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on Saving Throws against Plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede Movement, such those created by the Entangle spell."
Druid,Nature’s Ward,"When you reach 10th level, you can’t be Charmed or Frightened by Elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease."
Druid,Nature’s Sanctuary,"When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to Nature and become hesitant to Attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the Attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this Effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this Effect before it makes its Attack against you."
Druid,Circle Spells,"Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain Spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to Circle Spells connected to the land where you became a druid.

Choose that land—Arctic, coast, Desert, Forest, Grassland, Mountain, or swamp—and consult the associated list of Spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of Spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Fighter,Fighting Style,"You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose a Fighting Style from the list of optional features. You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.

Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to Attack rolls you make with Ranged Weapons.

Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other Weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to Damage Rolls with that weapon.

Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an Attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the Two-Handed or Versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your Reaction to impose disadvantage on the Attack roll. You must be wielding a Shield.

Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second Attack."
Fighter,Second Wind,"You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On Your Turn, you can use a Bonus Action to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 + your Fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or Long Rest before you can use it again."
Fighter,Action Surge,"Starting at 2nd Level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On Your Turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible Bonus Action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or Long Rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn."
Fighter,Martial Archetype,"At 3rd Level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your Combat styles and Techniques, such as Champion. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd Level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level."
Fighter,Indomitable,"Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level."
Monk,Unarmored Defense,"Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a Shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.
"
Monk,Martial Arts,"Your practice of Martial Arts gives you mastery of Combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk Weapons, which are shortswords and any simple Melee Weapons that don't have the Two-Handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk Weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield.

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the Attack and Damage Rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk Weapons.

- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your Unarmed Strike or monk weapon.

- When you use the Attack action with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on Your Turn, you can make one Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action. For example, if you take the Attack action and Attack with a Quarterstaff, you can also make an Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action, assuming you haven't already taken a Bonus Action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk Weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a Sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game Statistics provided for the weapon."
Monk,Ki,"Starting at 2nd Level, your Training allows you to harness The Mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or Long Rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's Effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Ki save DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Flurry of Blows
Immediately after you take the Attack action on Your Turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a Bonus Action.

Patient Defense
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a Bonus Action on Your Turn.

Step of the Wind
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a Bonus Action on Your Turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn."
Monk,Unarmored Movement,"Starting at 2nd Level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a Shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on Your Turn without Falling during the move."
Monk,Monastic Tradition,"When you reach 3rd Level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, such as the Way of the Open Hand. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd Level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
"
Monk,Deflect Missiles,"Starting at 3rd Level, you can use your Reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon Attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the Attack is reduced by 1d 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged Attack (range 20 feet/60 feet) with the weapon or piece of Ammunition you just caught, as part of the same Reaction. You make this Attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon Proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the Attack."
Monk,Slow Fall,"Beginning at 4th Level, you can use your Reaction when you fall to reduce any Falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level."
Monk,Stunning Strike,"Starting at 5th Level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon Attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a Stunning Strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be Stunned until the end of your next turn."
Monk,Ki-Empowered Strikes,"Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming Resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage."
Monk,Stillness of Mind,"Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one Effect on yourself that is causing you to be Charmed or Frightened."
Monk,Evasion,"At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area Effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a Fireball spell. When you are subjected to an Effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail."
Monk,Purity of Body,"At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.
"
Monk,Tongue of the Sun and Moon,"Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken Languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say."
Monk,Diamond Soul,"Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all Saving Throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result."
Monk,Timeless Body,"At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the Frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water."
Monk,Empty Body,"Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become Invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have Resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the Astral Projection spell, without needing material Components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you."
Monk,Perfect Soul,"At 20th level, when you roll for Initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points."
Monk,Monastic Traditions,"Three traditions of monastic pursuit are Common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse.

Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic Techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd Level."
Paladin,Divine Sense,"The presence of strong evil registers on your Senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any Celestial, fiend, or Undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the Vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a Long Rest, you regain all expended uses."
Paladin,Lay on Hands,"Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of Healing power that replenishes when you take a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to your Paladin level x 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 Hit Points from your pool of Healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple Diseases and neutralize multiple Poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending Hit Points separately for each one.

This feature has no Effect on Undead and Constructs."
Paladin,Fighting Style,"At 2nd Level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other Weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to Damage Rolls with that weapon.

Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an Attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the Two-Handed or Versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

"
Paladin,Divine Smite,"Starting at 2nd Level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon Attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each Spell Level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an Undead or a fiend."
Paladin,Spellcasting,"By 2nd Level, you have learned to draw on Divine Magic through meditation and prayer to cast Spells as a Cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of Spellcasting and chapter 11 for the Paladin spell list.

Preparing and Casting Spells

The Paladin table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your Spells. To cast one of your Paladin Spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.

You prepare the list of Paladin Spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Paladin Spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your Paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The Spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level Paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level Spell Slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared Spells can include four Spells of 1st or 2nd Level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared Spells.

You can change your list of prepared Spells when you finish a Long Rest. Preparing a new list of Paladin Spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per Spell Level for each spell on your list.

Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your Spellcasting Ability for your Paladin Spells, since their power derives from the Strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your Spellcasting Ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Paladin spell you cast and when Making an Attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Charisma modifier
Spell Attack modifier = your Proficiency Bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spellcasting Focus

You can use a holy Symbol as a Spellcasting focus for your Paladin Spells."
Paladin,Divine Health,"By 3rd Level, the Divine Magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease."
Paladin,Sacred Oath,"When you reach 3rd Level, you swear the oath that binds you as a Paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose an oath, such as the Oath of Devotion.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd Level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include Oath Spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

Oath Spells
Each oath has a list of associated Spells. You gain access to these Spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath Spells don’t count against the number of Spells you can prepare each day.
If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the Paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Paladin spell for you.

Channel Divinity
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical Effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or Long Rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity Effects require Saving Throws. When you use such an Effect from this class, the DC equals your Paladin spell save DC."
Paladin,Aura of Protection,"Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

If you also use your Divine Smite with an Attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite."
Paladin,Cleansing Touch,"Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a Long Rest."
Paladin,Sacred Oaths,"Becoming a Paladin involves taking vows that commit the Paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd Level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s Training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd Level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart."
Ranger,Favored Enemy,"Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of Favored enemy: Aberrations, Beasts, Celestials, Constructs, Dragons, Elementals, fey, Fiends, Giants, Monstrosities, oozes, Plants, or Undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of Humanoid (such as Gnolls and orcs) as Favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your Favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence Checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your Favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

Choose one type of Favored terrain: Arctic, coast, Desert, Forest, Grassland, Mountain, swamp, or The Underdark.

While traveling for an hour or more in your Favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:

Difficult Terrain doesn't slow your group's Travel.
Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
Even when you are engaged in another Activity While Traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
When you Forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

You choose additional Favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level."
Ranger,Spellcasting,"The Ranger table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your Spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these Spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Animal Friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Animal Friendship using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st level and Higher

You know two 1st-level Spells of your choice from the Ranger spell list.

Spell save DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Wisdom modifier
Spell Attack modifier = your Proficiency Bonus + your Wisdom modifier"

This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number."
Ranger,Land's Stride,"Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical Difficult Terrain costs you no extra Movement. You can also pass through nonmagical Plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on Saving Throws against Plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede Movement, such those created by the Entangle spell."
Ranger,Hide in Plain Sight,"Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, Plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are.

Once you move or take an action or a Reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit."
Ranger,Vanish,"Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a Bonus Action on Your Turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail."
Ranger,Feral Senses,"At 18th level, you gain preternatural Senses that help you fight creatures you can't see.

Ranger,Foe Slayer,"At 20th level, you become an unparalleled Hunter of your enemies.

You don't need advantage on the Attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't Incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the Attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table."
Rogue,Thieves' Cant,"During your rogue Training you learned Thieves' Cant, a Secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows Thieves' Cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a Message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of Secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a Safe House for thieves on the run."
Rogue,Cunning Action,"Starting at 2nd Level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a Bonus Action on each of your turns in Combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action."

Pact of the Chain
You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of Spells known.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following Special forms: imp, Pseudodragon, Quasit, or Sprite.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one Attack of its own with its Reaction.

Pact of the Blade
You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming Resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one Magic Weapon into your pact weapon by performing a Special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a Short Rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

Pact of the Tome
Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three Cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those Cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of Cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the Warlock spell list, they are nonetheless Warlock Spells for you.

If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour Ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This Ceremony can be performed during a short or Long Rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die."
Warlock,Mystic Arcanum,"At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical Secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the Warlock spell list as this arcanum.

There are too many invocations to list here. "
Warlock,"Otherworldly Patrons
","The beings that serve as Patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of Other Planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various Patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.

Some Patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other Patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one Warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, Siblings, or Rivals."
Wizard,Spellcasting,"As a student of Arcane Magic, you have a Spellbook containing Spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

Cantrips

If you prepare the 1st-level spell Magic Missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared Spells.

You can change your list of prepared Spells when you finish a Long Rest. Preparing a new list of Wizard Spells requires time spent studying your Spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per Spell Level for each spell on your list.

Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your Spellcasting Ability for your Wizard Spells, since you learn your Spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your Spellcasting Ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Wizard spell you cast and when Making an Attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Learning Spells of 1st level and Higher

Each time you gain a Wizard level, you can add two Wizard Spells of your choice to your Spellbook for free.

Wizard,Arcane Recovery,"You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your Spellbook. Once per day when you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended Spell Slots to recover. The Spell Slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 4th-level Wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of Spell Slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level Spell Slots."
Wizard,Arcane Tradition,"When you reach 2nd Level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation. Your choice grants you features at 2nd Level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level."
Wizard,Spell Mastery,"At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain Spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level Wizard spell and a 2nd-level Wizard spell that are in your Spellbook. You can cast those Spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the Spells you chose for different Spells of the same levels."
Wizard,Signature Spells,"When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful Spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level Wizard Spells in your Spellbook as your Signature Spells. You always have these Spells prepared, they don't count against the number of Spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd Level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or Long Rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

Arcane Traditions

The study of Wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.

The most Common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around The Schools of Magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of Spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train Apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the Spells of each school require mastery of different Techniques.

Wizard,Spellbook,"The Spells that you add to your Spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane Research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the Nature of the multiverse. You might find other Spells during your Adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient Library.

Copying a Spell into the Book: When you find a Wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your Spellbook if it is of a Spell Level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.

Copying that spell into your Spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the Wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your Spellbook using your own notation.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material Components you expend as you experiment with the spell to Master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other Spells.

Replacing the Book: You can copy a spell from your own Spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your Spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your Spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.

If you lose your Spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Spells that you have prepared into a new Spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your Spellbook requires you to find New Spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.

The Book’s Appearance: Your Spellbook is a unique compilation of Spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your Master, a finely bound gilt-­edged tome you found in an ancient Library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous Spellbook in a mishap."
